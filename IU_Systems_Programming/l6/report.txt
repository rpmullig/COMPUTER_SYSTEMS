Questions [3 points each]

    What does the CS pin do (the CS pin is called SS in the lab manual)?

-The CS pin selects which pin the master will communicate with.


    Why do you set the CS high at the end of the pin initializations? What other functions in f3d_gyro.c change CS from low to high or high to low?

- The CS pin is turned to high after initialization so that the peripheral can perform it's function as it waits for a read data command.

    How do you hook up multiple peripherals on one SPI bus?

-Multiple slaves can be connected through the MOSI pin. The certain CS pin is enabled through the driver software.


    The STM has an Operating Frequency of 72 MHz. When initializing SPI1, what do you set the baud rate prescaler to? What is the resulting SPI clock frequency?

-The baud rate is 96 MHz frequency is then set to 50MHz

    Does a peripheral (slave) need to be configured with the transmission speed before it can communicate with the microcontroler (master)? Why would you want to be able to do on-the-fly changes in transmission speed?

-No the peripheral does not need to be configured to transmission speed. The on-the-fly speed changes are useful for data reads at any time.

Describe what you learned and any difficulties you had:
	 The troubles I had were debugging and finding the error. I didn't how exactly the function worked. We also ran into problems
	when initializing the gyro. We required help to fix the error, because there weren't any good examples of how to do it.
	we accidently had selected the wrong pins as well.  

I learned more about UART and reading the key, more about pins and SPI, better understanding of initialization.
