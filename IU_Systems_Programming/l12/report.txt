Difficulties:
	wiring caused random hardware erros that we couldn't tell was a code or hardwrade error

What did I learn:
     how to read a wav file through opening the file and the C syntax for opening sound files
     More about enumeration

Questions 1)
 	  The peripheral base address the same as the DMA. Since it's a Direct Memory Address, it's a lot more sensitive and it points to DR. The DMA is also affected by the processor that is important for this.

Question 2)
 It's necessary to enable incremeting because it follows the way that FATS looks through blocks of info then doing this can prevent missing anything.

Question 3) 
	 Just in case the flag is set.

Question 4) 
	 The DMA transfer has overhead of anything over 4 bytes and it would not get any benefit out of it.

Question 5)
	  Since there's different peripheral addresses involved and DMA has it's own address.
