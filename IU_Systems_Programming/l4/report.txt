    1) What are specs of the board you are using (ex. Speed, RAM, Flash)?
       32-bit, single-cycle, 8 KB RAM, 128KB FLash, 2MHz
       
    2) What does GPIO stand for?
       "General Purpose Input/Output"

    3) *Disregarded question*

    4) What are the Port and Pin Numbers of the two Green LEDs?
      Port: E pin: 15 
      Port: E pin: 11 
       
    5) What are the public attributes of the GPIO_InitTypeDef Struct?
       GPIO_Pin, GPIO_Mode, GPIO_Speed, GPIO_PuPd

Were there any difficulties? If not, what did you learn? 

I had difficulties with syntax and finding all the points. Sometimes I didn't know what the correct systnax is. The documentation is fairly big, and sometimes I didn't know where to find the correct information. My github had SSH key problems.
