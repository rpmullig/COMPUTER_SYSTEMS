Each question is worth 3 points

-Discuss the advantages and disadvantages of printf debugging? Note: there is no right answer to this, we are just looking for your thoughts on the issue
    
Advantage: easy to use and you can see it
disadvantage: very very slow


-Explain why the spiReadWrite function is called inside a higher level peripheral function (the lcdWrite function).
because we need to read and write bits first


-Why does LCD_CS_DEASSERT() do? Why is it important?
to select the lcd as the chip


-Explain how the character data from the ASCII array in glcdfont.c gets converted to pixels.
you can conver the ASCII to binary by reading the bits using bit shift


-Give the exact timing difference between the two versions of f3d_lcd_fillScreen, from the Salae analyzer, and explain why the new function is faster.
Version 1 takes 80 milliseconds and version 2 takes 200 milliseconds. The first firstion is much faster. The new function is faster
because software can work quicker than hardware. So instead of sending each individual pixel, the fast one will
send to a buffer then send an entire row of data. 


Difficulties:

I had difficulties getting the screen to not flicker
wiring the board was difficult
the size of the screen was difficult to find, it was within code on the lab manual
Searching through pages and pages of the lab manual and documentation
