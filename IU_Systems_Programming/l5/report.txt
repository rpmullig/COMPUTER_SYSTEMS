Questions: 

   How many connections are required to communicate over UART?
         2  

    What is the purpose of "alternate functions" for GPIO pins?
    	 So other GPIO devices components can set up. 


    Define "baud rate" in your own words.
    	   Speed at which the computer can communicate with clocks is synchronized for communication purposes of sending and recieving electrical signals

    Why do we need newlib_stubs? Specifically, is there a reason that printf won't work on the board without it?
    	The board has a specific protocal that is required to communicate with it and a special library is required


    Give an example of a situation in which the Salae Logic Analyzer is the best debugging method and include a screen shot of the Logic application.
    	 When you don't have a visible out put to test and you'll need to see if the connection is working and reading the inputs
    



What did you learn, any difficulties you had:

-We didn't grab one of the 10 Logic analyzers to begin with, so we had to wait a long time before we could move on with the lab. 
-SerialT had pre-required settings that weren't listed in the instructions 
-Instructions were unclear
-Plugging in the wires confusing with different board types
