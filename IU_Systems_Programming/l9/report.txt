Q1) In previous labs, adding a peripheral has required pin initializations. Why were able to add the nunchuk without initializing anything? 

We've already initialized the pins on the I2C with the accellerometer

Q2) What are the major differences between these two functions and what does that imply about communicating with the nunchuk?

The register is required for read and not for nunchuk_read. 



Q3) What do all of these variables correspond to in the nunchuk?  

jx & jy is joystick data
ax,ay,ax is the accelometer data
c & z are the buttons


Q4)

Taking the array data[5] from the nunchuk and masking it into 0x03. It sets the buttons buttons to on or off depending on if they're pressed or not. 


Difficulties: 
Getting the data from accellerometer into a standard form.. we didn't know it was 0-1023
